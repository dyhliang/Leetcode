â€‹This problem can be solved using only one pass through the loop by leveraging the fact that we already know what the target value is, so rather than adding together combinations, we can simply use this target to subtract each value in the list as we iterate through. Any number we encounter that is not the missing number, we store in a hash table, with the number as the key, and its index as the value. If the difference between the target and the current number is found in the hash table, we can retrieve the index for the number to be returned alongside the index of the current number.
